I am a builder at heart with expertise in Computer Science, driven by curiosity to understand how the world works, why it is what it is today, and how can I contribute to build a better future. I am currently working to discover ways the emerging ecosystem of AI can be used to drive real change in enterprises.

I come from the city of [Kota, Rajasthan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kota,_Rajasthan). I am driven by a fascination with human ingenuity—specifically, the scientific inquiry used to decode nature's mysteries and the artistic efforts to cultivate dance, music, and culture. Beyond my professional work in computer science, I am deeply interested in physics, philosophy, and dance.

This website is my attempt to curate my notes and views on a diverse set of topics. As I read and understand more about the world, I realize how little I know. While I do not claim to be an expert, I sometimes find myself in the awkward position of having to explain things as one. I use this space to organize my thoughts, which you can explore in the [blogs' section](/blog/) and [bookshelf](/books/).
